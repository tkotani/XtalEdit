You can specify these Keys in *.csy.
e.g., (these are default values)
<AkaiKKR>
go  = 'go'
edelt = 0.001
ewidth= 1.0
reltyp= 'sra'
sdftyp= 'vwn'
magtyp= 'nmag'
record= '2nd'
outtyp= 'update'
bzqlty= 't'
maxitr= 40
pmix  = 0.020
CLASS AlFe field=0.000  # Supply your name of CLASS instead of AlFe here.
CLASS ...  field=...  
</AkaiKKR>
The order of keys are irrelevant.
RMT=xxx in CLASS (in the crystal structure section), supplys 
the MT radius used in AkaiKKR. If RMT is not given, it gets 
to be zero. This means AkaiKKR automatically determine it within the code.

Without <AkaiKKR> section, AkaiKKR button supplys default values.
(These defalut values are not necessarily to be suitable. 
 Especially note edelt and ewidth.)

c-------------This is taken from readin.f and modified.------------------
=== KeyWords can be used in <AkaiKKR> ===
go:      process is to be executed or not (go/ngo/dos/dsp).
fname:    Potential file name.
edelt:   small imaginary part attached to the Fermi energy.

ewidth:   width of the energy window covered by the energy contour.
reltyp:  type of relativistic treatment (nrl/sra/nrlls/srals).
sdftyp:  type of the parametrization of xc energy (vbh/mjw/vwn
         /lmmjw/lmvbh/pymjw/pyvbh/pyvwn). Switch 'asa' can be
         added, e.g., 'mjwasa' means that the atomic sphere
         approximation (ASA) is to be exploited.
magtyp:  magnetic state (mag/nmag/rvrs/-mag/kick) rvrs and -mag
         are equvalent. kick is used to kick off the system
         to be magnetic.
record:  record used as input potential (init/1st/2nd).
outtyp:  whether to update potential file or not (update/quit).
bzqlty:  quality of BZ mesh (t/l/m/h/u or any integer number).
maxitr:  maximum number of the iteration.
pmix:    mixing parameter.

CLASS {CLASS name} field:   external local magnetic field on this site.
