      integer function falsi(ax,bx,fa,fb,f,cof,ir,tol,itmax,x,fx)
C- Find a root by a modified regula falsi
C A modified version of the regula falsi method (secant method) to
C converge to a root, already assumed bracketed.  Falsi uses a
C simple scaling to avoid the usual convergence problems a highly
C nonlinear function near a root.  This scaling artifically divides
C one of the dependent variables by a scale factor.  If this
C point is discarded in the next iteration, the scaling has no
C effect, so the scaling only takes effect when one point is
C repeatedly thrown away.
C Inputs:
C AX and BX are two values of the independent variable;
C FA and FB are the associated function values (precomputed);
C F is the function name;
C TOL is the largest approximate relative error (can be zero); 
C ITMAX is the largest number of function iterations before FALSI quits
C Outputs
C X and FX are the best estimates of the root and associated value;
C ITER the number of iterations required to reach the root.

C ...   debugging

C ...   New iterate for function
        x = (ax*fb - bx*fa)/(fb-fa)

C ...   Decide which bound to update
