Cr Remarks
Cr  *Rdfiln reads an ascii string from logical file 'unit' into character
Cr   array 'recrd', with the option of parsing algebraic expressions in
Cr   the line, as described below.  Rdfiln also supplies some facility
Cr   for branching control to skip over reading of certain lines or
Cr   repeatedly reading a block of lines.  The caller calls rdfiln until
Cr   all the lines desired are read in, or until EOF is reached.
Cr
Cr   -------------- Conceptual overview --------------
Cr   For concretness, let's assume the following
Cr     cch(1) = '#' comment character
Cr     cch(2) = '{' character marking start of expression substitution
Cr     cch(3) = '}' character marking end of expression substitution
Cr     cch(4) = '%' rfiln directive character
Cr
Cr  *Expression substitution
Cr   rdfiln parses anything inside `{...}' and substitutes the contents for
Cr   `something else'.  For example, the contents of `{...}' may by an
Cr   algebraic expression.  In that case, rdfiln evaluates the expression
Cr   numerically, and turns it back into a number, in ascii form. Thus
Cr   a string read from 'unit' as
Cr      talk {4/2} me
Cr   becomes
Cr      talk 2 me
Cr   rdfiln evaluates '4/2' as a floating-point expression using a2bin.f,
Cr   turns the result back into an ascii string, using bin2a.f, and
Cr   substitutes the resultant substring for the original.
Cr   Caution: if the substituted string is longer than recl, it is truncated.
Cr
Cr  *Variables
Cr  *Rdfiln permits three kinds of variables, floating point scalar,
Cr   floating-point vector, and character.  It uses a2bin to evaluate
Cr   floating-point expressions and bin2a to recast the result as a string.
Cr   The scalar symbols table is maintained in the standard variables table,
Cr   File symvar.f contains the source code maintaining this table.; file
Cr   symvec.f contains source code maintaining the vector variables table.
Cr   (NB: symvec allocates space for these vectors through the malloc utility;
Cr   your compiler must have pointer capability to use this table.)  The table
Cr   of character variables is maintained in the character array ctbl, which is
Cr   passed as an argument to rdfiln.
Cr
Cr   NB: when EOF is reached, rdfiln eliminates any variables declared within
Cr   the input file using `%' constructs described below (see % save directive
Cr   below for exceptions to this rule).
Cr
Cr  *Comments
Cr   Lines beginning with the comment character are purged.
Cr
Cr  *Rdfiln directives
Cr   Lines beginning with '% directive', where directive is one of:
Cr     const cconst cvar udef var vec char char0 cchar getenv
Cr     if ifdef ifndef iffile else elseif elseifd endif include includo
Cr     while repeat end
Cr     echo show stop exit save trace vfind
Cr   are interpreted by rdfiln not as part of the input, but as a directive to
Cr   do something, such as assign a value to a variable; to conditionally skip
Cr   over a block of lines; to repeatedly read a block of lines using a 'loop'
Cr   construct; and some miscellaneous commands.  Each of these is described
Cr   in the 'Rdfiln directives' section below.
Cr
Cr   -------------- Expression substitution --------------
Cr    A string in `{}', e.g. `{strn}' may contain one of the following.
Cr    These are listed in order of precedence in which rdfiln tries to
Cr    parse the contents of `{...}' .
Cr    NB: The {} can be nested.
Cr
Cr      1. the name of a character variable, say `myvar'
Cr         In that case, rdfiln replaces string `{myvar}' with contents of
Cr         `myvar'.
Cr
Cr      2. a character variable name, say `myvar', followed by a qualifier (...)
Cr         which can be one of the following:
Cr
Cr        *(integer1,integer2) --- returns a substring of `myvar'
Cr         {myvar(n1,n2)} is replaced by the (n1,n2) substring of `myvar'.
Cr
Cr        *('char-list',n) --- marks a position in contents of `myvar'
Cr         {myvar('char-list',n)} is replaced by integer, which is the
Cr         index to the n'th occurence of one element in 'char-list'.
Cr         n is optional.
Cr         Example: If myvar="foo bar", {myvar('abc',2)} evaluates to 6.
Cr
Cr        *(:e) --- returns an integer marking last nonblank character
Cr         Example: If myvar='foo bar', {myvar(:e)} evaluates to 7.
Cr
Cr        *(/'str1'/'str2'/,n1,n2) --- string substitution
Cr         {myvar(/'str1'/'str2'/,n1,n2)} substitutes str2 for str1
Cr         It does it for the n1'th to n2'th occurence.
Cr         n1 and n2 are optional, as are the quotation marks.
Cr         Example: If myvar="foo boor", {myvar(/'oo'/a/,2,2)} = "foo bar"
Cr
Cr      3. The name of a vector variable, say `myvec'
Cr         rdfiln replaces '{myvec}' with a sequence of numbers each separated
Cr         by one space, which are the contents of myvec'  Thus
Cr           % vec myvec[5] 5 4 3 2 1
Cr           {myvec}
Cr         becomes
Cr           5 4 3 2 1
Cr         (The first line declares `myvec' to be vector of length 5 and
Cr         initializes its contents; see description of % vec below)
Cr         Alternatively you can substitute a single element.  Thus
Cr           {myvec(2)}
Cr         is transformed into
Cr           4
Cr
Cr      4. a string consisting an algebraic expression of scalar numbers and
Cr         previously declared variables.  (variables are declared and set with
Cr         '%' directives; see 'Rdfiln directives' section below.)  rdfiln
Cr         parses the expression, turns the result into a string, and
Cr         substitutes the string in place of {expression}.  This is a special
Cr         case of the following:
Cr
Cr      5. A variable assignment, or a sequence of assignments separated by
Cr         commas.  This syntax returns the value of the (last) expression,
Cr         while assigning variables to evaluated expressions.
Cr         NB: the last expression need not have an assignment operator
Cr         {x=3}               ->  is replaced by '3'
Cr         {x=3,y=4}           ->  is replaced by '4'
Cr         {x=3,y=4,x*=y}      ->  is replaced by '4'
Cr         {x=3,y=4,x*=y,x*2}  ->  is replaced by '24'
Cr
Cr         The general syntax is:  {var assignment-op expr [, ... ]} .
Cr         The following are the allowed operators:
Cr         assignment-op         function
Cr           '='            simple assignment
Cr           '*='           replace 'var' by var*expr
Cr           '/='           replace 'var' by var/expr
Cr           '+='           replace 'var' by var+expr
Cr           '-='           replace 'var' by var-expr
Cr           '^-'           replace 'var' by var^expr
Cr         NB: it is permissible to omit the 'var assignment-op' pair;
Cr         may be be useful for the final expression, as in the last example.
Cr
Cr      6. A C-like syntax of the form '{?~expr~strn1~strn2}'
Cr         If expr evaluates to nonzero, the {...} is replaced by strn1
Cr         If expr evaluates to zero, the {...} is replaced by strn2
Cr         NB:  the '~' above can be any character
Cr
Cr   To summarize, emphasizing the order of precedence: rdfiln first looks to
Cr   see if the contents of `{...}' is the name of a character variable, or a
Cr   name followed by qualifiation (...).  If so, `{...}' is replaced by the
Cr   (possibly qualified) value of the variable.  If not, rdfiln sees whether
Cr   the contents of `{...}' is the name of a vector variable.  If so, rdfiln
Cr   substitutes `{...}' into a character representation of the vector as
Cr   described in step 3 above.  If this fails, rdfiln parses `{...}' as a
Cr   scalar expression, or a sequence of expressions, and `{..}' is replaced by
Cr   a character representation of the result (4 and 5 above).
Cr
Cr   Example:  suppose that the variables table looks like:
Cr     Var       Name                 Val
Cr      1        t                   1.0000
Cr      2        f                  0.00000
Cr      3        pi                  3.1416
Cr      4        a                   2.0000
Cr   ...
Cr     Vec       Name            Size   Val[1..n]
Cr      1        firstnums          5    1.0000        5.0000
Cr      2        nextnums           5    6.0000        10.000
Cr   ...
Cr       char symbol                     value
Cr      1 c                               half
Cr      2 a                               whole
Cr      3 blank
Cr
Cr   NB: The scalar variables table always begins with predefined variables
Cr   t=1,f=0 and pi.  It is STRONGLY ADVISED that you never alter any of
Cr   these variables.
Cr
Cr   You can print out the current tables of variables with the 'show'
Cr   command; see below.  (Because the vector variables can have arbitrary
Cr   length, 'show' prints only the size of the vector and the first and
Cr   last entries.  As described in more detail below, you can create such
Cr   a variables table with the following directives:
Cr
Cr   % const a=2
Cr   % char c half a whole blank " "
Cr   % vec firstnums[5] 1 2 3 4 5
Cr   % vec nextnums[5] 6 7 8 9 10
Cr
Cr   Then rdfiln substitutes for the line
Cr    {c} of the {a} {pi} is {pi/2}
Cr   yields the following:
Cr    half of the whole 3.1415926536 is 1.5707963268
Cr
Cr   whereas the line
Cr    one quarter is {1/(nextnums(4)-5)}
Cr   becomes
Cr    one quarter is .25
Cr
Cr   The following illustrates substitution of character substrings:
Cr   % char c half a whole
Cr    To {c(1,3)}ve a cave is to make a {a(2,5)}!
Cr   becomes
Cr    To halve a cave is to make a hole!
Cr
Cr   The following line illustrates substitution of vector name
Cr    {firstnums}, I caught a hare alive, {nextnums} ...
Cr   becomes
Cr    1 2 3 4 5, I caught a hare alive, 6 7 8 9 10 ...
Cr
Cr  *Nesting of {...}.  If the contents of {...} contain an
Cr   inner block of {}, the inner block is subtituted first, as
Cr   the following illustrates.  The following line
Cr      % const xx{1{2+{3+4}1}} = 2
Cr   undergoes substitution in three passes
Cr      % const xx{1{2+71}} = 2
Cr      % const xx{173} = 2
Cr      % const xx173 = 2
Cr
Cr   This line combines nesting and '{?~expr~strn1~strn2}' syntax:
Cr      MODE={?~k~B~C}3
Cr   evaluates to, if k is nonzero
Cr      MODE=B3
Cr   or, if k is zero:
Cr      MODE=C3
Cr
Cr   -------------- Rdfiln directives --------------
Cr  This section describes the syntax for each of the directives rdfiln
Cr  understands.
Cr
Cr  *'const', 'cconst' and 'var' load or alter the variables table.
Cr   A variable 'myvar' is declared eg,  % const  myvar = expr.
Cr   'expr' may be multiplied into, divided into, added into,
Cr   subtracted from or exponentiated into an already-declared variable
Cr   using one of the following C-like syntax:
Cr     myvar*=expr  myvar/=expr  myvar+=expr  myvar-=expr  myvar^=expr
Cr
Cr   'const' and 'var' are equivalent except that, for a variable
Cr   already declared, 'const' ignores a re-declaration of the
Cr   variable (nam=val), thus preserving its original value, while
Cr   'var' alters its value; see example below.
Cr
Cr   'cconst' is a conditional 'const': the first argument following
Cr   'cconst' is an expression; declarations following the expression
Cr   are parsed only if the expression evaluates to true.
Cr
Cr   'cvar' is a conditional 'var': the first argument following
Cr   'cvar' is an expression; declarations following the expression
Cr   are parsed only if the expression evaluates to true.
Cr
Cr   .... Example: for the input file
Cr     % const a = 2 b=3 c=4 d=5
Cr     a={a} b={b} c={c} d={d}
Cr     % const a=3
Cr     % var d=-1
Cr     % const b*=2 c+=3
Cr     a={a} b={b} c={c} d={d}
Cr     % cconst b==6  b+=3 c-=3
Cr     a={a} b={b} c={c} d={d}
Cr     % cconst b==6  b+=3 c-=3
Cr     a={a} b={b} c={c} d={d}
Cr
Cr   generates four lines:
Cr     a=2 b=3 c=4 d=5
Cr     a=2 b=6 c=7 d=-1
Cr     a=2 b=9 c=4 d=-1
Cr     a=2 b=9 c=4 d=-1
Cr   'a' is unchanged from its initial declaration while 'd' changes.
Cr    The two 'cconst' show that 'b' and 'c' are altered in the first
Cr    instance, since then 'b==6' is true, while are unchanged in
Cr    the second instance, since this time 'b==6' is no longer true.
Cr
Cr  *'char' and 'cchar' load or alter the character table. Directive
Cr   % char  c half     a whole      blank
Cr   loads the character table as follows:
Cr       char symbol                     value
Cr      1 c                               half
Cr      2 a                               whole
Cr      3 blank
Cr   The last value may be a blank string. 'cchar' has the syntax
Cr   % cchar nam  expr1 str1 expr2 str2 ...
Cr   expr1 expr2 etc are algebraic expressions and 'nam' takes the
Cr   value 'str1' if expr1 evaluates to true (ie nearest integer is
Cr   nonzero), the value 'str2' if expr2 evaluates to true, etc.
Cr   Re-declaration of any previously defined variable has the effect
Cr   of changing the contents of the variable
Cr  *'char0' is the same as 'char', except re-declaration of existing
Cr   variables is ignored.
Cr  *'getenv' is the same as 'char', except the string char holds
Cr   is used as a name for an environment variable, and its value
Cr   is replaced by the value of the enviroment variable.  Thus
Cr  % getenv myhome HOME
Cr   puts the string of your home directory into variable 'myhome.'
Cr
Cr  *'vec' loads or alters elements in the table of vector variables.
Cr   % vec v[n]                  creates a vector variable of length n
Cr   % vec v[n] n1 n2 n3 ...     ditto, first elements are also set
Cr   NB: Once 'v' is already declared, elements of v may be set with
Cr   the following syntax, which sets all elements bewtween i1..i2
Cr   % vec v(i) n                or
Cr   % vec v(i1:i2)  n1 n2 ... nn
Cr   There must be exactly i2-i1+1 elements n1 ... nn.
Cr   Also, if 'v' is already declared, it is an error to re-declare it.
Cr
Cr  *'vfind' finds the entry in an array that matches a specified value:
Cr   % vfind v(i1:i2)  name match-value
Cr   parses v(i) for i=i1..i2 and sets variable 'name' to i when it
Cr   finds v(i)=match-value.  If no match, 'name' is set to zero.
Cr   .... Example, the lines
Cr   % vec  a[3] 101 2002 30003
Cr   % vfind a(1:3) i 2002    <---- will set  i to 2
Cr   % vfind a(1:3) i 10      <---- will set  i to 0
Cr
Cr  *'save' preserves some variables for future use
Cr   % save              preserves all variables defined to this point
Cr   % save name [name2 ...]                saves only variables named
Cr   NB: only scalar variables may be saved.
Cr
Cr  *'udef' deletes a variable and its definition.
Cr   Only scalar and character variables may be deleted
Cr   rdfiln aborts with error if no variable exists to 'undefine'
Cr  *'udef -f' is equivalent to 'udef' except that 'udef -f' does
Cr   nothing if an attempt is made to udefine a nonexistent variable
Cr
Cr  *'trace' when turned on, chatters about how rdfiln parses the input
Cr           Invoking 'trace' with no argument toggles whether it is
Cr           on or off.
Cr           'trace 0' turns the tracing off (the default)
Cr           'trace 1' turns the tracing to lowest level:
Cr                     all directives having to do with execution flow
Cr                     (if-else-endif, repeat/while-end)
Cr           'trace 2' prints some information about most directives.
Cr
Cr  *'echo' echos the current line to stdout (i1mach(2)).
Cr  *'stop expr msg' aborts with 'msg' if 'expr' evaluates to true
Cr  *'show' prints out various things:
Cr   % show lines       (echos each line generated to the screen until:
Cr   % show stop         is encountered)
Cr   % show vars        (prints out the state of the variables table)
Cr
Cr   Expressions are evaluated for both echo and stop before printout.
Cr
Cr  *'if expr', 'elseif expr', 'else' and 'endif' are conditional read
Cr   blocks.  Lines between these directives are read or not,
Cr   depending on the value of the expression following 'if.'  For
Cr   .... Example, the lines
Cr   % if Quartz
Cr    is clear
Cr   % elseif Ag
Cr    is bright
Cr   % else
Cr    neither is right
Cr   % endif
Cr   generate one line ' is clear', if Quartz is true, ' is bright' if
Cr   Ag is false but Quartz is true, ' neither is right' otherwise.
Cr
Cr  *ifdef is similar to if, but has a more general idea of what
Cr   constitutes an expression.  First, 'if' requires a valid
Cr   expression, while 'ifdef' treats an invalid expression (eg one
Cr   containing an undefined variable) as a valid expression evaluating
Cr   to false.  The syntax of ifdef allows several expressions :
Cr   ifdef expr1 [| expr2 | expr3 ...]
Cr   and if any of expr1, expr2, ... evaluate to true, the result
Cr   is true, whether or not preceding expressions are valid.
Cr   The spaces here are syntatically significant here, since
Cr   expr1|expr2 is only true if both expr1 and expr2 are valid
Cr   expressions, while expr1 | expr2 may be true if either is valid.
Cr   'ifdef'  allows a limited use of character variables in
Cr   expressions. Either of the following are permissible expressions:
Cr     char-variable            (T if char-variable exists, otherwise F)
Cr     char-variable=='string'  (T ifchar-variable equals "string")
Cr   .... Example: ifdef  x1==2 | atom=='Mg'
Cr     is true if scalar 'x1' is 2, or if character variable
Cr     "atom" is equal to "Mg".
Cr   Also, the 'expr' above can be groups of subexpressions of any type
Cr   just mentioned, separated by ' & '.
Cr   .... Example: ifdef  x1==2 & atom=='Mg' | x1===1
Cr     is true if scalar 'x1' is 1, or 'x1' is 2, and character
Cr     variable "atom" is equal to "Mg".
Cr  *'elseifd' is to 'elseif' as 'ifdef' is to 'if'.
Cr  'if' and/or 'ifdef' constructs may be nested to a depth of mxlev.
Cr  *'ifndef' expr ... is equivalent syntatically to
Cr   'ifdef'  expr ... followed immediately by 'else'
Cr
Cr  *iffile file-name  is another conditional read block.  Instead of
Cr   the condition being set by an expression, it it set by whether
Cr   file 'file-name' exists.
Cr
Cr  *'while' and 'end', or 'repeat' and 'end' are looping constructs,
Cr   as illustrated below.  The 'while' construct has the syntax
Cr     % while [assignment assignment ...] expression
Cr      lines here are repeatly read in while expression is true
Cr     % end
Cr   here the (optional) assignments following expression have the
Cr   same syntax and meaning as the 'const' construct.  That is,
Cr   they look like 'nam=expr' or 'nam op= expr'.  As in the 'const'
Cr   case, 'nam=expr' only has effect when the variable 'nam' has
Cr   is not in the variables table.  This is made evident in the
Cr   example below.  'repeat' has the syntax
Cr     % repeat varnam list
Cr       lines here are reread, for each value 'varnam' takes in list;
Cr       list can be an integer, eg '7' or a more complex integer list,
Cr       eg '1:3,6,2' -- see mkilst.f for the syntax of an integer list.
Cr     % end
Cr   .... Example:  note in the 'while' construct the assignment
Cr        'db=-1' is operative only the first time, while 'db+=2'
Cr        is changes db in every loop.
Cr   % const nm=-3 nn=4
Cr   % while db=-1 db+=2 db<=3
Cr   % repeat k= 2,7
Cr   this is k={k} and db={db}
Cr   {db+k+nn+nm} is db + k + nn+nm, where nn+nm={nn+nm}
Cr   % end (loop over k)
Cr   % end (loop over db)
Cr   .... is expanded into
Cr   this is k=2 and db=1
Cr   4 is db + k + nn+nm, where nn+nm=1
Cr   this is k=7 and db=1
Cr   9 is db + k + nn+nm, where nn+nm=1
Cr   this is k=2 and db=3
Cr   6 is db + k + nn+nm, where nn+nm=1
Cr   this is k=7 and db=3
Cr   11 is db + k + nn+nm, where nn+nm=1
Cr
Cr  *include file-name causes rdfiln to open file 'file-name', and
Cr   input is read from the new file until EOF, after which lines are
Cr   read from the calling file.  %include may be nested to a depth
Cr   of 10.  NB:  repeat-end and if-endif constructs MUST reside in the
Cr   same file.  'includo' is identical to 'include', except that the
Cr   rdfiln aborts if the file does not exist.
Cr   Sandwiching include directives inside constructs is permissible.

Cr    2.  It is an invalid numerical expression, but expr is
Cr        the name of a character variable
Cr    3.  It is of the form    var=='string'
