===These buttons are for space-group operations.===

  Gen 0   !Search site positions for given generator.
          !Then find additional symmetry generator.
          !You can start from no given generators 
  Gen 1   !Search site positions for given generator.
  Gen 2   !Check consistency. Use given symmetry generator.

These functions add a line,e.g,
  GEN i*r3(1,1,-1)::(1/4,1/4,1/4) r4x::(1/4,1/4,1/4)
at the top of *.csy file. Or read them and do something as wrtten above.
Each thing after GEN means space-group generators.

--- How to read the expression of space-group generators?---
A symbol describing a generator for a point group operation has
the form O(nx,ny,nz) where O is one of M, I or Rj for mirror,
inversion and j-fold rotation; and nx,ny,nz are a triplet of
indices specifying the axis of operation.  It can be integer 
or real numbers. You may use X, Y, Z or
D as shorthand for (1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1), (1,1,1).  
You may also enter products, such as I*R4X.

As for space-group operation, we have to add translation
after rotation in some cases. 
They should be given by appending a string in the
form `::(p1,p2,p3)' to the point group operation.
These defines the translation \Delta
in prvec(1:3,1),prvec(1:3,2),prvec(1:3,3) in unit alat.
\Delta(1:3) = p1*prvec(1:3,1) +p2*prvec(1:3,2) + p3*prvec((1:3,3)
Parser routine is subs/psymop.f 
An example for Si is
    i*r3(1,1,-1)::(1/4,1/4,1/4) r4x::(1/4,1/4,1/4)

ag in SYMOPS.ops is in Cartasian.
So ag(1:3) = \Delta(1:3) = p1*prvec(1:3,1) +p2*prvec(1:3,2) + p3*prvec((1:3,3)


!!!Note!!! This version might not work well when given primitive vectors 
PV* are not the smallest translations. (so note in cases supercell and so).

============================================
See Module/Generator/README in detals.
The format of Generators are originally from LMTO packages
in Anderson group in MPI Stuttgart.

Tha matrix elements of space group operations are in SYMOPS.out.
