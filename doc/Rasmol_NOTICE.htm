<H2 align=center>The IUCr Policy<BR>for the Protection and the Promotion of the 
STAR File and<BR>CIF Standards for Exchanging and Archiving Electronic Data</H2>
<P>
<H3>Overview</H3>
<P>The Crystallographic Information File (CIF)[1] is a standard for information 
interchange promulgated by the International Union of Crystallography (IUCr). 
CIF (Hall, Allen &amp; Brown, 1991) is the recommended method for submitting 
publications to Acta Crystallographica Section C and reports of crystal 
structure determinations to other sections of Acta Crystallographica and many 
other journals. The syntax of a CIF is a subset of the more general STAR File[2] 
format. The CIF and STAR File approaches are used increasingly in the structural 
sciences for data exchange and archiving, and are having a significant influence 
on these activities in other fields. 
<P>
<H3>Statement of intent</H3>
<P>The IUCr's interest in the STAR File is as a general data interchange 
standard for science, and its interest in the CIF, a conformant derivative of 
the STAR File, is as a concise data exchange and archival standard for 
crystallography and structural science. 
<P>
<H3>Protection of the standards</H3>
<P>To protect the STAR File and the CIF as standards for interchanging and 
archiving electronic data, the IUCr, on behalf of the scientific community, 
<P>* holds the copyrights on the standards themselves, 
<P>* owns the associated trademarks and service marks, and 
<P>* holds a patent on the STAR File. 
<P>These intellectual property rights relate solely to the interchange formats, 
not to the data contained therein, nor to the software used in the generation, 
access or manipulation of the data. 
<P>
<H3>Promotion of the standards</H3>
<P>The sole requirement that the IUCr, in its protective role, imposes on 
software purporting to process STAR File or CIF data is that the following 
conditions be met prior to sale or distribution. 
<P>* Software claiming to read files written to either the STAR File or the CIF 
standard must be able to extract the pertinent data from a file conformant to 
the STAR File syntax, or the CIF syntax, respectively. 
<P>* Software claiming to write files in either the STAR File, or the CIF, 
standard must produce files that are conformant to the STAR File syntax, or the 
CIF syntax, respectively. 
<P>* Software claiming to read definitions from a specific data dictionary 
approved by the IUCr must be able to extract any pertinent definition which is 
conformant to the dictionary definition language (DDL)[3] associated with that 
dictionary. 
<P>The IUCr, through its Committee on CIF Standards, will assist any developer 
to verify that software meets these conformance conditions. 
<P>
<H3>Glossary of terms</H3>
<P>[1] CIF: 
<P>is a data file conformant to the file syntax defined at 
http://www.iucr.org/iucr-top/cif/spec/index.html 
<P>[2] STAR File: 
<P>is a data file conformant to the file syntax defined at 
http://www.iucr.org/iucr-top/cif/spec/star/index.html 
<P>[3] DDL: 
<P>is a language used in a data dictionary to define data items in terms of 
"attributes". Dictionaries currently approved by the IUCr, and the DDL versions 
used to construct these dictionaries, are listed at 
http://www.iucr.org/iucr-top/cif/spec/ddl/index.html
