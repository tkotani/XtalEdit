<h2><B><A name="Intro">Introduction</A></H2></B></h2>
XtalEdit is a flexible crystal-structure modelling tool,
especially for electronic structure calculations.<br>
<br>
In ab-initio electronic structure calculation for solids, 
we have to make crystal-structure models at first.
These are not only for ideal crystals but also for 
somehow virtual situations.
For example, we have to add a bit of displacements for atoms,
to insert impurities, to make a surface with atoms, and so on.
XtalEdit is to build these models.
<br><br>

XtalEdit is with simple GUI, which consists of 
EditWindow, ResultWindow, and Buttons of functions.
With these, you can interactively make your models.
<img src="xscreen3.jpg">

For example, a crystal structure is described in our 
format (csy1 file) as in the above EditWindow,
<pre>
---------------- from here ------------------------------------------
au=0.529177
a =  3.82/au   #  a is in a.u.
c =  6.26/au   #  c  is in a.u.
CV1 = 1/2.* a * EX - 1/2. *sqrt(3) * a * EY
CV2 = 1/2.* a * EX + 1/2. *sqrt(3) * a * EY
CV3 = c * EZ

PV1 =  CV1
PV2 =  CV2
PV3 =  CV3

SITE TYPE=    ZnFe, POS=  1/3. *PV1 + 2/3. *PV2 +  PV3
SITE TYPE=    ZnFe, POS=  2/3. *PV1 + 1/3. *PV2 + 1/2.   *PV3
u= 3./8
SITE TYPE=    S, POS=  1/3. *PV1 + 2/3. *PV2 +   u  *PV3
SITE TYPE=    S, POS=  2/3. *PV1 + 1/3. *PV2 + ( u +1/2. ) *PV3

TYPE ZnFe  LMX=3, ATOM = (Zn:0.9)(Fe:0.1)
TYPE S     LMX=3, ATOM = (S:1.0)
----------------- to here ---------------------------------------------.
</pre>

I think that you can guess what this means. keywords are<br>
EX,EY,EZ:  Cartesian orthnormal basis<br>
CV1,CV2,CV3: Conventional cell vectors<br>
PV1,PV2,PV3: Primitive cell vectors<br>
SITE : atomic site. <br> 
TYPE : atomic type (equivalent sites)<br>
<br>
XtalEdit recognize this csy1 format.
There are tools to do <br>
(1)Check symmetry operations of this system <br>
(2)Add new atoms based on symmetry operations<br>
(3)Supercell button can generate supercell<br>
(4)View with Rasmol<br>
(5)I/O of input files as for AkaiKKR, lmf(testing), ABINIT(testing version).<br>
and so.

For example, this picture is just after you push the button "Generator-mode0". 
<img src="xscreen4.jpg">
You can see that 
space-group symmetry informations appears in the ResultWindow and
&lt;GEN&gt; section appears in the EditorWindow.
It contains generators of space-group operation for this system.
This "Generator-mode0" can also supplement SITE if &lt;GEN&gt; section 
exists and given SITE is not complete.<br>
<br>
Further it is so easy to customize it, and to write and add your own module.

In addition, it contains 230 space-group templates *.csy1 
(with full lists of Wycoff positions). 
Thus you can easily set up the above *.csy1 file if 
you know the required parameters as taken from databases.
<br>
See<A href="./indexuse.htm"> Usage </A>for detail.

<h2><B><A name="ACKNOWLEDGEMENT">ACKNOWLEDGEMENT</A></H2></B><BR></h2>
XtalEdit is mainly developed based on <br>
 * python2.2 + Numerical python (not included in the XtalEdit package)

 * csymtool
   A fortran routine as for spece-group symmetry.
   It is constructed from subroutine packages originally from:
   " The STUTTGART TB-LMTO-ASA program.
     http://www.mpi-stuttgart.mpg.de/andersen/docs/lmto_program.html
     http://www.mpi-stuttgart.mpg.de/andersen/LMTODOC/LMTODOC.html
     For the symmetry part of the program, 
     mostly written by Georges Krier MPI-FKF."
   We thank Prof.Dr.O.K.Andesen to allow us to use them in XtalEdit.

 * TSPACE(Dr.Yanase. We generated space-group samples from it), 

 * <A href="http://olymp.phys.chemie.uni-muenchen.de/ak/ebert/xband.html">XBAND (H.Ebert,Munich)</a> We learned so much from it.

 * <A href="http://www.bernstein-plus-sons.com/software/rasmol/README.html">Rasmol (molecule viewer)</A>.<br>
We thank to them so much.
Further, we also leaned so much from stuffs on Web and so.<br>
<br>
In addition, we really appreciate strong support from the Japan Research Institute, Limited,
through the General Manager Mr. Shinji T Shibano.

<h2><B><A name="INSTALL">DownLoad and Install</A></H2></B><BR></h2>
Out package is for Windows and Linux+Pentirum.
XtalEdit should work with python2.2 + numerical python + java for any platform.
However, our package include rasmol for binaries (csymtool)
only for them. Thus you have to do some job by yourself if your platform is not
Windows neither Linux+Pentium.
<br><br>

===For Windows===
  At first, get a package XtalEdit09*.tar.gz. From the
  <A href="http://sham.phys.sci.osaka-u.ac.jp/~kkr/XtalEdit/download">XtalEdit download Page</A>. Usually, latest in better.
  The package is for both of Windows and Linux-pentium.

1. Install Jave runtime environment (JRE). Java1.4.1 or Higher.
   You can do it easily through <A href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/download.html"> java.sun.com</A>.

2. Install python2.2.3.
   Lower versions of python does not work with Numerical python.
  * python download: <A href="http://www.python.org/2.2.3/">English version</A>.
                     <A href="http://www.python.jp/Zope/download/pythoncore">Japanease version</A>.

3. Install Numerical python on it. Take Numeric-22.0.win32-py2.2.exe or so and install.
  * <A href="http://www.pfdubois.com/numpy/">Numerical python Homepage</A>.
  * <A href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/numpy/Numeric-22.0.win32-py2.2.exe?download">Numeric-22.0.win32-py2.2.exe</a>

   Then you have to add the path to python with 'control-panel'-system-'environmental variable'.

4. Just expand the package in a directory (XtalEdit's root directory).

5. Invoke XtalEdit with XtalEdit.bat in the XtalEdit's root directory.

---Trouble shooting ---
   check1. GUI is not invoked --->java is not working. Check path to java!
   check2. Try "print 1+2" in EditWindow and push RunPython. Then do you have "2" in ResultWindow?
           If you don't, it means python is not recognized by XtalEdit. ---> Check path to python!
   check3. python2.3 may cause a minor problem problem in rasmol button. ---> Use python 2.2.2 or 2.2.3


===For Linux(Pentium)===
1. Install Jave runtime environment (JRE). Java1.4.1 or Higher.
   You can do it easily through <A href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/download.html"> java.sun.com</A>.

Then you have to get a installer <A href="http://sham.phys.sci.osaka-u.ac.jp/~kkr/XtalEdit/download/XtalEdit_Install_for_Linux">XtalEdit_Install_for_Linux</A>.
The followings are almost automatic.

2. Install python2.2 or above. and
3. Install Numerical python on it.
4. Just expand the package in a directory (XtalEdit's root directory).
   As for these procedures you can use the Installer script
   <A href="http://sham.phys.sci.osaka-u.ac.jp/~kkr/XtalEdit/download/XtalEdit_Install_for_Linux">XtalEdit_Install_for_Linux</A>.
   It invokes "wget" so as to get required packages, expand them and install them
   under the directory which you invoke XtalEdit_Install_for_Linux.
   You may have to see and modify it a bit.
   Then it makes a starter script XtalEdit in the directory.
   Edit the starter script XtalEdit so as to set the correct path to java.

Even without using the installer, XtalEdit should work if python2.2, Numerical python and
java correctly. So you don't need to stick the above procedure.
However, python is sometimes assigned as python2 (in Redhat and so) 
and system configulation may be a bit different.
Such a thing sometimes may cause trouble. So we recommend you to follow the above procedure.
The script compile python and numerical python. So it will take 5 to 10 minutes.
